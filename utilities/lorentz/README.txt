for more information about the Lorentz tests.

The results for four of the tests (the others aren't relevant to
CHIANTI) are obtained with the routines:

lorentz_test_1_csd
lorentz_test_2_power
lorentz_test_3_top_lines
lorentz_test_7_levelpop

Each test creates a text file in the working directory. It is
recommended that you label the directory with the CHIANTI version
number. For example, '09_00_00' for version 9.
