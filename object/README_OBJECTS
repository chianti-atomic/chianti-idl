Notes on how to use the CHIANTI object

May 9, 2013

This is currently underdevelopment and there is a lot of messy diagnostic output.

there is only one Chianti object, 'chianti_ion' and several methods

_____________________________________________________

> ne9 = chianti_ion('ne_9')

> temp = 10.^(6.3 + 0.1*findgen(11))

> den = 1.e=9

> ne9.populate,temp,den

> population = ne9.getpopulation()

	population is a structure, right now it contains a lot of extraneous information
	
> ne9.emiss_calc()

> emiss = ne9.getemiss()

	emiss is also a structure currently containing a lot of extraneous information
