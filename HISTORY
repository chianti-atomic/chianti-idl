% list of changes for v7.0 update 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
gofnt.pro
;	V.16, 22-Jun-2011 Corrected bug that arose when upper_levels or 
;             lower_levels is an array with one element, Terry Kucera

make_chianti_spec.pro
;               v.22, 25-Jul-2011, Peter Young
;                 Changed units for the isothermal case back to
;                 "cm-2 sr-1 s-1" instead of "cm+3 sr-1 s-1". This
;                 reverses the change made in version 19.

;            with IDL 8.

make_chianti_spec.pro
;               v.20, 7-Oct-2009, Peter Young
;                 Modified call to continuum routines to use new
;                 EM_INT keyword (for isothermal plasmas).
;                 
;               v.21, 6-Oct-2010, Peter Young
;                 Corrected bug related to the v.20 modification.

ch_synthetic.pro
;         v.31,  23-Sep-2010, Peter Young
;                 Changed name of LIST array to MLIST for
;                 compatibility with IDL 8.

;             For ions with a large number of transitions (e.g., Fe
;             XVIII) it was impossible to select lines with large
;             wavelengths as the integers weren't defined as
;             longs. This has been fixed now. Also fixed bug when
;             selecting strongest lines for ions with less than 15
;             transitions. 

ch_xmenu_sel.pro
;       V.11, 14-Jun-2010, Peter Young

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

make_chianti_spec.pro
;               v.18, 4-May-2006, Peter Young
;                 Changed LAMBDA to be a double array in order to correct a
;                 problem with line profiles for very small bin sizes.
;                 Problem pointed out by Matthew West (Imperial).

matrix_solver.pro
;    Ver.2, 10-Mar-2006, Peter Young
;        commented out warning message about status as the level populations
;        are still accurate to < 0.001% when this occurs and so it's not
;        neccessary to warn users.

freefree.pro
;    V. 5, 9-Mar-2006, Peter Young
;          Added /kev keyword

freebound.pro
;      Ver.4, 10-Mar-2006, Peter Young
;           added keV keyword

two_photon.pro
;       v.13, 10-Mar-2006, Peter Young
;                  added /keV keyword 

make_chianti_spec.pro
;               v.17, 10-Mar-2006, Peter Young
;                 The /keV keyword is now passed to the continuum routines,
;                 rather than make_chianti_spec performing the conversion
;                 itself.

itoh.pro
;    Ver.4, 9-Mar-2006, Peter Young
;            Added /keV keyword.

sutherland.pro
;       Ver. 4, 9-Mar-2006, Peter Young
;           Added /keV keyword.

freebound_ion.pro
;      Ver.4, 10-Mar-2006, Peter Young
;          Added /keV keyword

integral_calc.pro
;       V.8, 6-Feb-2006, Peter Young
;              Integration is now performed on d(logT) intervals, rather than
;              dT intervals following problems identified by Luca Teriaca.

correct_pops.pro
;    Ver.3, 1-Feb-2006, Peter Young
;        Corrected error: sum of populations is now renormalized to 1.

show_pops.pro
;       v.17, 12-Dec-2005, Peter Young
;              routine now performs check on existence of .splups file
;              instead of .elvlc since with v.5 some ions have a .elvlc
;              file but nothing else (fe_3, fe_4)


isothermal.pro 
;       V.9, 3-Oct-2005, GDZ
;              Now the FOR loop accepts more than 32000 lines.

ch_ss.pro
;       V.13, 3-Oct-2005 GDZ
;          Replaced FOR i=0, calls with FOR i=0L, calls, so 
;          the routine does not crash with a large number of lines.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
THE FOLLOWING ARE CHANGES TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN V. 5.1:

SETUP/use_chianti.pro
;               V.10,  19-Sept-2005, GDZ 
;                   made last version backward-compatible.


low_level/continuum/get_ieq.pro

;      v.2, 14-Sept-2005, GDZ
;      modified error message.

 extra/show_pops.pro

;       V.16, 14-Sept-2005 Giulio Del Zanna 
;              modified header.

isothermal.pro 

;       V.8, 14-Sept-2005 GDZ 
;              Added ALL keyword and modified header, error message.


two_photon.pro
;       v.12,  31-Aug-2005, GDZ
;                  missed one correct definition of ioneq_ionrec. Fixed it now. 
make_chianti_spec.pro

;               v.16, 31-Aug-2005, GDZ
;                 Fixed a typo (keyowrd_set).

ch_synthetic.pro

;         v.28,  31-Aug-2005, GDZ
;                 Fixed bug concerning the case when multiple temperatures 
;                 (i.e. logt_isothermal) were defined as input. The program
;                 was, in some cases, returning null values.
;                 The problem was the use of nt, the number of good temperatures
;                 for each ion, for the definition of the arrays, instead of
;                 using the number of logt_isothermal values (and the t_index).



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
THE FOLLOWING ARE CHANGES TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN V. 5:

extra/ratio_plotter.pro
;       V.40, 18-Aug-2005, Peter Young
;             Corrected bug for temperature version of routine that led to
;             mismatch between stated parameters and plotted parameters


extra/ratio_plotter.pro

;       V.39, 17-Aug-2005, Peter Young
;             Adjusted layout of widget, modified printing of wavelengths
;             in the plot window, and adjusted plot limits for log scale.


low_level/pop_solver.pro

;       V. 20  16-Aug-2005, Peter Young
;               Routine now catches any NaN values in the level populations
;               and prints a warning. All pops are set to zero in this case.


low_level/correct_pops.pro

;    Ver.2, 16-Aug-2005, Peter Young
;        Changed total_exc to be dblarr in order to prevent NaNs.


extra/ratio_plotter.pro

;       V.38, 15-Aug-2005, Peter Young
;             Corrected bug introduced by modification above.


extra/ratio_plotter.pro

;       V.37, 15-Aug-2005, Peter Young
;             Corrected bug with derived densities when the theoretical ratio
;             is double-valued.


SETUP/use_chianti.pro

;               V.9,  12-Aug-2005, GDZ 
;                   Changed default ioneq file from mazzotta_etal_ext to 
;                   mazzotta_etal_9.ioneq where ion fractions have been extended
;                   up to 10^9 K. This is useful to avoid steps in the
;                   emissivities at high-temperatures.
;

ch_line_list.pro
;        v.9, 4-Aug-2005 GDZ
;           Corrected a bug introduced in the previous version.
;           Also switched to \documentclass when making the latex file.

extra/ratio_plotter.pro

;       V.36, 12-Aug-2005, GDZ
;             Reinstated some previous cosmetic features. Also adjusted
;             some sizes, added some checks (e.g. minimum is set to 1e-10 if
;             plot is in log scale -to avoid log(0)-; automatic scaling cannot
;             be set if log scale is on).


plot_populations.pro

;       V 11, 12-Aug-2005, GDZ 
;                  The number of levels is now optional. Also, a check that the
;                  number of levels must be less than the levels in the file is
;                  now enforced.

extra/pop_processes.pro
;      Ver.6, 1-Jul-2005, Peter Young
;          added warning for ions with ionization/recombination


ch_line_list.pro
;        v.8, 18-Jul-2005 GDZ
;           Modified the use of the /kev keyword. Also, now the
;           routine accepts input structure with the units in keV. 


ch_synthetic.pro              
;         V 26,    17-Apr-2004, Enrico Landi (EL)
;                  Added the recombination/ionization population processes.
;
;         V.27,    13-Apr-2005, EL
;                  Replaced the main loop to calculate individual line intensities
;                  with operations among arrays, to speed the whole program in case
;                  of large numbers of lines.

ch_ss.pro
;       V.11,  22-Jul-2005  GDZ 
;
;          -Added keV option and a few more extra checks.
;       V.12,  2-Aug-2005 GDZ
;           put RETAIN=2 in the main plotting window.


freefree.pro
;       V 4, 25-May-2005, GDZ 
;                  corrected routine header.

freebound.pro
;       V 3, 25-May-2005, GDZ

;               v.13 26-Apr-2005, Enrico Landi (EL)
;                   Fixed a minor bug: if the lines were more than 32768 (2^15), the main
;                                loop crashed.
;               v.14 22-Jul-2005 GDZ 
;                 -fixed a bug. When the routine was run once without
;                 defining the lambdas, and then with the lambdas
;                 defined (the units were switched to photons)
;                 -fixed a bug. When the effective areas were used,
;                 all lines were used to create the spectrum.
;                 -added hard-wired switch to photons when using
;                 effective area files.
;
;                 -added the keV option
;
;                 -now can output a spectrum only with the continuum
;                 (i.e. even if no emission lines are present). 
;
;               15, 2-Aug-2005, GDZ 
;                 Added a check on the input structure. If it was
;                 calculated with ch_synthetic and the keyword
;                 /no_sum_int, it cannot be used here.

plot_populations.pro      
;       V 10, 4-May-2005, Enrico Landi (EL)
;                  Modified in order to include ionization and recombination
;                  data in the input to POP_SOLVER, now it allows choice of .ioneq
;                  file needed to include ionization and recombination.

rad_loss.pro
;       V 5, 25-May-2005, GDZ 
;                  corrected routine header.

two_photon.pro
;       V.9,  8-Jun-2004, EL

;             Also, the Ne(Te), ratio values are now printed to a pop-up
;             window through the new 'SHOW RATIO VALUES' button rather
;             than printed to the text window (see V.31).
;       V.33, 7-Nov-03, Giulio Del Zanna 
;             Modified the popup widget by calling xpopup and adding

------------------------------------------------------------
low_level/pop_solver:

;               -removed all COMMON blocks (note that only proton_dens.pro has
;                one: COMMON elements,abund,abund_ref,ioneq,ioneq_logt,ioneq_ref)
;               -only the essential information input is passed to the routine
;                via a new input structure.
;               -fixed a bug, that affected all the satellite lines, and was 
;                introduced in v.12,  included in  CHIANTI v.4.0.
;                basically the ionization potential was not subtracted when
;                calculating the Delta E in the exponential.

for all the following routines, modified the input to POP_SOLVER,
 now it is dealt with an input structure:

ch_synthetic.pro
plot_populations.pro

ch_synthetic.pro

;         V. 22, 19-Aug-03, Peter Young
;                  when logem_isothermal is input, the derived EM is now a
;                  DOUBLE array rather than FLOAT, preventing infinities when
;                  logem_isothermal values are large.

extra/ratio_plotter.pro

;       V.30, 28-Aug-03, Peter Young

density_ratios: (GDZ)

              Major revision:
              -Added the keyword VERBOSE, to avoid printing out long lists of lines.
              -Removed the call to ch_xselect_s, that did not work for long lists.
              -Added a '*' in the line lists, to identify 'unobserved' lines.
              -Replaced the commands to create PS file, to make it
               cross-platform compatible.
              -Added a large number of cosmetics, mainly lables to the axes and
               titles, that were missing.
              -Removed plotting in windows already present.
              -Added the CHIANTI version number in the outputs.

               the 'unobserved' ones. 
              -Added the CHIANTI version number in the outputs.

temperature_ratios: (GDZ)

              Major revision:

              -Added the CHIANTI version number in the outputs.

EMISS_CALC:  (GDZ)
                   Modified the use of Version, to make it compatible with the
                   other CHIANTI v.4 routines.

emiss_select: (GDZ)
             Replaced the entire  widget with a call to ch_xmenu_sel.
             This works fine with very long lists of lines, while previously
             the widget was very slow and sometimes would hang.

ch_xmenu_sel: (GDZ)
         Modified a few cosmetics, and add the option to have a TEXT string
         array to add as a comment in the top widget.

use_chianti:  allow for backward compatibility with v.3 of the database
              (the abundance files have changed names from v.3 to v.4 !!! ).(GDZ)

ratio_plotter Another fix. (PRY)

make_chianti_spec: (GDZ)
                    speeded up the routine, by changing the way the PEAK tag is
                    added to the structure. The drawback is that only the
                    'standard v.4 tags' are allowed, and future additions will
                    have to be dealt properly. Added VERBOSE options.

two_photon: added keyword VERBOSE

use_chianti: removed the '***' (GDZ)

ch_line_list: better info printed (GDZ)

ch_ss:            
            Restored the correct use of ch_line_int, now only the lines in the
            plot window are listed, and the ALL keyword is in use. 
            Now the correct xrange is loaded into COMMON when line int. are
            restored. Now it checks if all ions were in the structure, when
            restoring the line intensities, and flags the widget button accordingly.
            Added a device,decomposed=0. to remove problems with colors.
            Corrected the use of the DEM, IONEQ and ABUND pulldown menus,
            avoiding conflicts between files in the working and CHIANTI
            directory having the same name.
            Added printing of references for ancillary files, and a check on the
            element abundances vs. the elements present in the structure.


ch_get_file:  corrected for a bug in the directory output.(GDZ) 

ratio_plotter (PRY)
              changed the temperature/density text widget so that numbers 
              are registered even if the return key has not been hit.

pop_solver:    within the equation solving section, I've set 
                the population of the ground level (rather the n_level level) 
                to 1, and this seems to stop negative populations appearing 
                in extreme conditions. (PRY)

show_pops:  added POPSTR output, and tidied up header. (PRY)
